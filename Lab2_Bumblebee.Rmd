Question I would analyze data to answer: I am currently pursuing a certificate in quantitative finance through the Leeds School of Business. I am quite interested in the financial markets and am interested in analyzing data on various portoflios with respect to market conditions in order to analyze how various factors affect portfolio returns.

Six months after graduation: I would like to begin my career as a trader working for a firm that employs quantitative and algorithmic strategies. 

Five years after graduation: I would like to be in the place where I can be own my own business, perhaps start my own fund.

Greatest career accompishment: I interned with Franklin Templeton Investments last summer which was a major stepping stone in the progression of my career.

In this course: In this course I hope to learn how to use GitHub efficiently, learning how to work with my team, and apply interesting data analysis methods.

Fun fact: I grew up in Doha, Qatar!

My name is Brady Kiesling and I am from the Bay Area. One question I would want to answer by analyzing is a theory that punting in football is never a good idea. Some high-school coaches have theorized that always going for it on 4th down is the better option, but I want to know if this is true and at what levels of football. Six months after graduation, I would like to see myself starting grad school after taking some time off to do some traveling. 5 years after I graduate I would ideally like have a stable job, so I can pay back loans and afford to do the things I love, like skiing and playing golf. My greatest career accomplishment would be to build up enough trust in a company, where I can work remotely the majority of the time. In this course, I would like to learn how to properly format and interpret data using R and I would like to learn good teamwork skills. One thing you may not know about me is that I am really into improv theater and try to go to shows as much as possible. Unfortunately I was unable to continue Improv in college due to time constraints.

Question I would analyze data to answer: I am interested to know how closely standardized test scores like the ACT correspond to graduating GPA in college.

Six months after graduation: Six months after graduating, I hope to have a job in industry. Ideally, I am using statistical reasoning and modeling to answer questions at my job.

Five years after graduation: Five years after graduation, I would like to be integrating the disciplines of writing and mathematics. Five years after graduation, I would like to be writing about statistical methodology and how it affects our perception of numbers.

Greatest career accomplishment: My biggest career goal is to have my scientific writing appear in a major journal or publication.

In this course: In order to reach my larger goals, I hope I learn how to code in R effectively and cogently in this course. This will allow me to create statistical models and answer questions I am likely to encounter on the job. Learning how to code cleanly will allow me to collaborate with other data scientists.

Fun fact: I have an unusually large cat named Salad.
